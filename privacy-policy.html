            <h4>General notes and mandatory information</h4>
            <p><b>Privacy</b></p>
            <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.<br>
                When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done.<br>
                We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. A complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Note on the responsible entity</b></p>
            <p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
            <p>Tobias Walddörfer<br>Säntisstraße 19<br>88099 Neukirch</p>
            <p>Telefon: +4915234036686<br>E-Mail: tobias.walddoerfer@gmail.com</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Storage duration</b></p>
            <p>Unless a more specific storage period is mentioned in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you request justified deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. tax or commercial law retention obligations). In this case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>General information on the legal basis for data processing on this website</b></p>
            <p>If you have given your consent to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Article 6(1)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR, insofar as it concerns special categories of personal data pursuant to Article 9(1) of the GDPR. If you have expressly consented to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the processing will also be carried out on the basis of Article 49(1) lit. a DSGVO. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your terminal device (e.g. by means of device fingerprinting), the data processing will additionally be carried out on the basis of Section 25 (1) of the German Telemedia Act (TMG). Your consent can be revoked at any time. Insofar as your data is required for the fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Article 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO. In addition, we process your data, insofar as this is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, on the basis of Article 6 (1) lit. c DSGVO. Data processing may also take place on the basis of our legitimate interest pursuant to Article 6(1) lit. f DSGVO. In the following sections of this privacy policy, we will inform you about the respective legal bases that are relevant in the specific individual cases.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Revocation of your consent to data processing</b></p>
            <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected.</p>
            <p><b>Right to object to the collection of data in specific cases and to direct marketing (Article 21 GDPR)</b></p>
            <p>If the data processing is based on Article 6(1)(e) or (f) DSGVO, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time on grounds relating to your particular situation, including profiling based on these provisions. Please refer to this privacy policy for the respective legal basis for the processing. If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims (objection under Article 21(1) DSGVO).</p>
            <p>If your personal data is processed for the purpose of direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of such marketing, including an objection related to profiling, insofar as it is related to such direct marketing. If you object, your personal data will subsequently no longer be used for direct marketing purposes (objection under Article 21(2) DSGVO).</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Right of complaint to the competent supervisory auth</b></p>
            <p>In the event of a breach of the GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged breach. The right of appeal is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Right to data portability</b></p>
            <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to yourself or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done insofar as it is technically possible.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Information, correction and deletion</b></p>
            <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Right to restriction of processing</b></p>
            <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. For this purpose, you can contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
                <li>If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you may request the restriction of data processing instead of erasure.</li>
                <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or enforce legal claims, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
                <li>If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a balancing of your and our interests must be carried out. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may - apart from being stored - only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>SSL or TLS encryption</b></p>
            <p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or requests that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Objection to advertising e-mails</b></p>
            <p>The use of contact data published within the framework of the imprint obligation to send advertising and information materials not expressly requested is hereby prohibited. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam e-mails.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Cookies</b></p>
            <p>The Internet pages partly use so-called cookies. Cookies do not cause any damage to your computer and do not contain viruses. Cookies serve to make our offer more user-friendly, more effective and safer. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.<br>
                Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies". They are automatically deleted after the end of your visit. Other cookies remain stored on your terminal device until you delete them. These cookies allow us to recognize your browser on your next visit.<br>
                You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If you deactivate cookies, the functionality of this website may be limited.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Request by e-mail, phone or fax</b></p>
            <p>If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your inquiry including all resulting personal data (name, inquiry) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We will not pass on this data without your consent.</p>
